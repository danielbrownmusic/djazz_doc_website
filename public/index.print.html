<a href="/index.html">Georges Bloch</a>, et
<a href="http://www.danielbrownmusic.com" rel="external" target="_self">Daniel Brown</a>.</p>
<p>Il s&rsquo;agit d&rsquo;un programme de musique g√©n√©rative qui improvise en utilisant du mat√©riel provenant de partitions pr√©enregistr√©es ou de contributions humaines live.</p>
<p>N√© de l&rsquo;improvisation jazz, il a √©t√© √©tendu √† la world music et √† l‚Äô√©lectro, et utilise une structure de donn√©es connue sous le nom Factor Oracle pour calculer, beat par beat, le mat√©riel √† jouer.</p>
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>Djazz √©tait con√ßu pour s‚Äôadapter √† diff√©rents styles musicaux.
L&rsquo;un des grands enjeux de sa r√©√©criture est de lui donner une conception suffisamment modulaire pour pouvoir modifier facilement le style musical ainsi que l&rsquo;algorithme de calcul des improvisations.</p>

<p><a href="#R-image-561eac092389e78914988f51bad29e17" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="pic1" class="bg-white border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/1_manual/2_main_window/images/MIDI_view_button.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>

<p>Clicking on the button labeled &ldquo;MIDI&rdquo; or &ldquo;Audio&rdquo; will open the MIDI or Audio interface window, respectively. You can also use the key commands &ldquo;m&rdquo; to open/close the MIDI window or &ldquo;a&rdquo; to open/close the audio window.</p>
<h2 id="2-beat-input">2. BEAT INPUT</h2>
<h3 id="input-selector">Input Selector</h3>
<p>Djazz plays a beat each time it receives a message (a &ldquo;tap,&rdquo; or &ldquo;click&rdquo;), if it is engaged (how to engage Djazz will be explaind below). When not engaged, it will not play when a beat message is received. When this is the case, you can click on measures or chapters (&ldquo;cells&rdquo; of the grid) in the song grid without triggering playback. Once engaged, djazz will begin playing on the next beat after a cell has been clicked on.</p>
<p>The cells of the grid change color depending on whether Djazz is engaged and whether a cell is currently playing or not. The colors represent the following:</p>
<p>Light gray: not the current measure/chapter of the song
Dark gray: the current measure measure/chapter of the song, but Djazz is not engaged
Blue: the current measure measure/chapter of the song, but not playing
Orange: the current measure measure/chapter of the song, and playing</p>
<p>There are three ways to send Djazz a beat message; you select one from the dropdown menu: &ldquo;manual,&rdquo; &ldquo;metronome,&rdquo; or &ldquo;remote.&rdquo;  Selecting from the dropdown menu will change the controls on the left side of this box. When one option is selected, the other two are not responsive.</p>
<h3 id="metronome">Metronome</h3>
<p><a href="#R-image-11f983c773a472e7935da14e74191fda" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="pic1" class="bg-white border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/1_manual/2_main_window/images/metronome_button_and_tempo.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-11f983c773a472e7935da14e74191fda"><img alt="pic1" class="bg-white border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/1_manual/2_main_window/images/metronome_button_and_tempo.png"></a></p>
<ol>
<li>The button marked with a triangle turns the metronome on and off. When you turn this button on and then select a grid cell, the metronome will trigger a new beat each time it clicks, beginning with the beat represented by the grid cell. No beat will be triggered until a grid cell has been selected.</li>
<li>The number selector sets the metronome tempo. This is automatically set when a new song is loaded, but you can change it.</li>
<li>This flashes each time the metronome sends a beat.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="manual">Manual</h3>
<p><a href="#R-image-17cc56799cd1959a7eef1a5e41e929a5" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="pic1" class="bg-white border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/1_manual/2_main_window/images/manual_bang_and_tempo.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-17cc56799cd1959a7eef1a5e41e929a5"><img alt="pic1" class="bg-white border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/1_manual/2_main_window/images/manual_bang_and_tempo.png"></a></p>
<ol>
<li>The triangle button engages Djazz.</li>
<li>Clicking on the circle button sends Djazz a beat message. You can also press the space bar to send a manual click.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="remote">Remote</h3>
<p><a href="#R-image-9a46633fbf37948ee127f7b2d6c23ebe" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="pic1" class="bg-white border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/1_manual/2_main_window/images/metronome_button_and_tempo.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>

This will send a beat message to Djazz every time a MIDI note on message is received (i.e., with a non-zero velocity) on any channel.</p>
<ol>
<li>The dropdown menu selects the MIDI input port for the click.</li>
<li>The triangle button engages Djazz.</li>
<li>This flashes each time a beat is received.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="click-sound-selector">Click sound selector</h3>
<p>The right-hand side of the window lets you change the sound and output port of the click.</p>
<ol>
<li>Changes the pitch of the click. The number indicates the MIDI value of the pitch.</li>
<li>The channel of the click.</li>
<li>The volume of the click</li>
<li>Mutes/unmutes the click</li>
<li>The output port of the click.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="3-song-selector">3. Song selector</h2>
<p><a href="#R-image-2827f2fce8dec6399f4d10aa6de7dab7" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="pic1" class="bg-white border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/1_manual/2_main_window/images/1_song_file_selector.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>

<p>To load a song grid, select a song using one of these controls. Songs are loaded by selecting <em>folders</em>, not individual files. Each folder contains various files pertaining to the song like scores and JSON metadata files.</p>
<ol>
<li>Drag and drop a song folder here.</li>
<li>Browse for a song folder. To select a song, click on its folder.</li>
<li>Clear the current song.</li>
<li>Select a preloaded song from the dropdown menu.</li>

At the top are listed the &ldquo;chapters&rdquo; of the song&ndash;different sections like verses, choruses, and bridges. Clicking on a chapter will take you to the first measure of the chapter. If Djazz is engaged, it will start playing from here when the next beat is received.</p>
<h3 id="bar-select">Bar Select</h3>
<p><a href="#R-image-a65310456dfd6b8fec2e26c7da8846b6" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="pic1" class="bg-white border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/1_manual/2_main_window/images/bar_grid.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>

Turns the improviser on. When this is on, the MIDI track(s) is/are not played back straight, but beats are chosen based on the harmony and the next two controls, continuity and potch range:</p>
<h3 id="continuity">Continuity</h3>
<p><a href="#R-image-41afdd0f13973baa7f767365083e0ce2" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="pic" class="bg-white border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/1_manual/3_midi_window/images/track_effect_continuity.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>

This determines the length in beats that sections of the score will be played back in sequence. Once this many beats has been played in sequence, the improviser will jump to a new section of the score. <p>
The maximum coninuity is 255 beats. When the &ldquo;MAX&rdquo; button is on, this will be the continuity&ndash;i.e., the score will be played back without improvising, i.e. jumping around through it (given that the score is &lt; 255 beats long. If you&rsquo;re using this with a score that&rsquo;s longer than 255 beats and you just want to play the score straight, there&rsquo;s no reason to be even using the improviser.)</p>

The improviser tries to match beats that have the same harmony as the current beat. By adjusting the pitch range, it will look for beats with a similar chord type but with roots above or below the current chord root. A pitch range of <i>n</i> will look for chords between (and including) <i>n</i> semitones below and <i>n</i> semitones above the current chord root. Set to zero, it will match the chord root exactly. Beats with different roots will be transposed to the proper harmony.</p>

<p>Djazz comes with many preloaded songs, but you can also load your own songs to play and improvise on.
To do this, you need to make two files: a <a href="/1_manual/6_tools/make_song_file.html"><em>song file</em></a> and a <a href="/1_manual/6_tools/make_score_file.html"><em>score file</em></a>. This section contains instructions on the two included tools that let you create these files.</p>

<h1 id="making-a-song-file">Making a Song File</h1>

<p>Djazz uses a <em>song file</em> to play a song, whether you are plaing back scores or using live MIDI or audio. Where a <em>score file</em> contains the notes in each beat of the song, a <em>song file</em> contains all the metadata for each beat: its label, its position in the song, and what chapter of the song it is in.
Djazz uses labels that represent chords. In this way, a <em>song file</em> is like a chord chart.</p>
<p>To create a <em>song file</em> for a new song you want to play with Djazz, the <strong>make_song_file</strong> Max patcher is provided for you in the <em>tools</em> folder.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-8f64eead488f08c2440acbd863298117" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="make-song-file-tool" class="bg-white border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/1_manual/6_tools/make_song_file/images/make-song-file-tool.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-8f64eead488f08c2440acbd863298117"><img alt="make-song-file-tool" class="bg-white border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/1_manual/6_tools/make_song_file/images/make-song-file-tool.png"></a></p>
<h3 id="song-name">SONG NAME</h3>
<p>Enter the name of the given song; this will be displayed when the song file is loaded, and will also appear in the song dropdown menu if it is placed in the <em>djazz_user/scores/</em> folder</p>
<h3 id="beats">BEATS</h3>
<p>Enter here the total number of beats in the song.</p>
<h3 id="tempo">TEMPO</h3>
<p>Enter the song tempo. This tempo will be loaded into Djazz&rsquo;s metronome when the song is loaded, and is also the tempo that will be expected if <a href="/1_manual/1_installation.html">manual tap entry is performed</a></p>
<h3 id="time-signature">TIME SIGNATURE</h3>
<p>Enter the number of beats per measure, i.e. the top number in the time signature. The duration of the beats, i.e. the bottom number in the time signature (4 for quarter note, 8 for eighth note, etc.) does not matter; do not include it.</p>
<h3 id="chapter-start-bars">CHAPTER START BARS</h3>
<p>If the song is divided into chapters, enter here the bar (i.e. measure) numbers at which the chapters begin.
For instance, if a song contains four chapters of 16, 16, 32, and 64 bars, in that order, the chapter start bars will be 1, 17, 33, and 65. Enter these numbers without commas</p>
<p>Putting all this together, here&rsquo;s what you would enter for a song in 4/4 time, with chapters of duration as above: 16, 16, 32, and 32 bars. The number of beats is the total number of bars multiplied by the time signature; in this case (16 + 16 + 32 + 64) * 4 = 128 * 4 = 516</p>

<h3 id="beat-labels">BEAT LABELS</h3>
<p>Beat labels are input in a text-based format. They can be entered directly into the tool&rsquo;s window, or cut and pasted from a text editor.</p>
<p>A chord label has two parts, the <em>root</em> and the <em>quality</em>. The way of entering labels is as follows:</p>
<p>‚ÄÉ (&lt; <em>chord root</em> &gt; ‚ÄÉ &lt; <em>chord quality</em> &gt; ‚ÄÉ &lt; <em>number of consecutive beats</em> &gt;)</p>
<p>&lt; <em>chord root</em> &gt; can be the symbol C, C#, Db, D, D#, Eb, E, F, F#, Gb, G, G#, Ab, A, A#, Bb, or B.</p>
<p>&lt; <em>chord quality</em> &gt; can be any symbol that does not contain an underscore (&quot;_&quot;) or a semicolon(&quot;;&quot;).</p>
<p>The improvisation algorithm
functions in part by matching these symbols with the symbols on the beats in score files, so if you want it to work correctly, keep the format of these symbols the same. For instance, the preloaded songs in Djazz use the following symbols:</p>
<p>‚ÄÉ <em>maj7, min7, 7, dim7, maj6, min6</em></p>
<p>But you can define any symbols you want:</p>
<p>‚ÄÉ <em>dom7#9b9#11, maj6add9, min6withanextraweirdnoteatthetop</em>, etc.</p>
<p>&lt; <em>number of consecutive beats</em> &gt; is how many beats this particular label is repeated.</p>
<p>So for instance, the chord sequence</p>
<p>‚ÄÉ Amaj7 ‚ÄÇ Amaj7 ‚ÄÇ Dmin7 ‚ÄÇ Amaj7<br>

<p>HOW TO MAKE A NEW SONG FILE FOR DJAZZ.</p>
<p>A song file is not a score file. It does not contain any notes to play. It contains the navigation information in the song: chapters, bars, beats chord labels, and tempo, in order to make the grid and send the master clock and factor oracle the appropriate data.</p>
<p>Here is how to make one. There are seven (7) steps listed below.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Open the patcher ‚Äúdjazz.make_song_file.maxpat‚Äù from the folder ‚Äúpatchers/data_conversion_tools‚Äù in the current djazz folder.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the appropriate fields, put in the song name, beat count, tempo, time signature, and the starting bars for each chapter. This data is exactly the same, and in the same order, as the data listed for the songs in the old Djazz version, EXCEPT FOR ONE DIFFERENCE: don‚Äôt use quotation marks when you put in the start bars. Only put in the list of numbers (and don‚Äôt use commas).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Put the grid data in the ‚Äúgrid data‚Äù box. Put it in (or copy and paste it) in LISP-style notation, where each entry is a list:  ( chord-root   chord-type-symbol   number-of-measures  )
Do not use outer parentheses for the whole list of lists.
Do not include any comments or semi-colons.
Spacing and indentation is not important.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Press the ‚Äúsave‚Äù button.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Save the song file in the folder of the same song name that contains the subfolders ‚Äúnew‚Äù and ‚Äúnew2.‚Äù The file name and the song folder name should be exactly the same.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Ôøº</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>
<p>That‚Äôs all. If the folder you put the new song file in has scores in its ‚Äúnew‚Äù and ‚Äúnew2‚Äù subfolders, this song can now be played as usual by Djazz.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Press the ‚Äúclear‚Äù button to clear the data.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="making-a-score-file">Making a Score File</h1>

<p>Score files contain preloaded notes, formatted so that Djazz can play them and use them to improvise.
Djazz comes preloaded with many score files of jazz standards and songs from Madagascar. You can also
convert your own MIDI files into Djazz scores with the <em>make_score_file</em> Max patcher, located in the <em>tools</em> folder.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Load a song file
If you haven&rsquo;t yet made a song file for this song, make one using the <a href="/1_manual/6_tools/make_score_file.html">make_song_file</a> tool.
Import the song file by pressing the LOAD button. If the file is loaded properly, the light on the left side will illuminate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Load a click track
A click track is needed to divide the notes in the MIDI tracks into the proper beats.
A click track must be imported from a MIDI file in which eat beat is designated by a single MIDI event at pitch C1 and non-zero velocity
The click track be exported at the same tempo as the notes.
<a href="/1_manual/6_tools/make_score_file.html">click track image</a></p>
<p>Import the MIDI file by pressing the &ldquo;IMPORT MIDI&rdquo; button and selecting the file from the dialog that opens.
Once imported, you can save this file to a JSON format using the &ldquo;SAVE JSON&rdquo; button.
If the click track file is loaded properly, the light on the left side will illuminate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If both the song file and click track have loaded successfully, the regions for loading MIDI tracks will be activated.
You can load either a single MIDI track, or multiple tracks at once. If you import multiple tracks, the resulting JSON file will represent a Djazz <em>score</em>, which you will need to put into a folder in order to play it in Djazz (see below).</p>
<p>Once you have imported, either in the single or multiple MIDI track format, save your import by pressing the SAVE button. The resulting file will be a JSON file.</p>
<p>To play a <em>single</em> MIDI track, see these instructions.</p>
<p>To play <em>multiple</em> MIDI tracks, you need to put your saved file in an appropriately named folder.</p>
<p>MAKING SCORE FOLDERS</p>
<p>Multiple MIDI tracks saved together are called a <em>score</em> in Djazz. Score files need to be organized in a certain way for Djazz to read them.</p>

- outputs a beat number when it receives a bang
- increments its beat number with each output, but also keeps track of position in a song form and adjusts the beat in accordance if looped.
- keeps track of tempo if tempo is manually input and fluctuates. This uses antescofo.
- reads from song dict to get label
- sends tempo, beat, and chord label, immediately in succession and in that order, to midi and audio generators. This order is important,  so that the generators can calculate the correct information to play at the beginning of each beat.</p>

<p>3. Parameters and Listeners</p>
<p>The view/control exposes the variables that can be changed by the user. It also exposes the ways in which these controls can be changed: as bools, ints, floats, bounded, etc.</p>
<p>To attach a device or remote controller to the system, we can use the parameter system, which is independent from the pattr system but whose functionality overlaps with it in a useful way.</p>
<p>Each pattr can be saved as a parameter. In addition, each control surface object can be saved as a parameter. When objects containing parameters are created (like midi tracks), new parameters are created.</p>
<p>Two javascript objects then allow for device connection. The ParameterInfoProvider lists all the parameters, and alerts us when parameters are added or removed.</p>
<p>A javascript object contains a parameterInfoProvider and an array of ParameterListeners. Each time a parameter is added, a parameter listener is created for it.</p>
<p>This javascript object centralises parameter communication. When a parameter is changed, it sends out its name and value. It receives values too.
Essentially it‚Äôs a replica of the pattrstorage object. Why use it?
Because the parameters are mapped to our control surface, not the model. We can take into account the control object logic; several buttons that change the same pattr can be saved as different parameters. Then we have more than one typed interface to the variable: we can control it as a toggle, or an int. For instance, the loop variable can be controlled by buttons with a launchpad, and by the number box with the ring. All you need to do is expose the desired control type and set is as a parameter. Again, the underlying model is unaffected.</p>
<p>Parameter listener and maxobjlisteners are hard to deal with because you can‚Äôt delete them.</p>

<h1 id="dicts">Dicts</h1>

<ol start="4">
<li>Dictionary readers and writers</li>
</ol>
<p>Dictionaries are used in different ways, for representing songs, architecture, and as another example for the launchpad, to keep track of how buttons are mapped to parameters and how parameters are mapped to lights. For this, several different types of dictionaries were required:</p>
<p>DICTS AND ARRAYS</p>
<ul>
<li>Two <strong>device-specific</strong> dicts</li>
<li>One <strong>mapping</strong> dict</li>
<li>Two <strong>runtime parameter</strong> dicts</li>
</ul>
<p>Launchpads have both view and control capabilities; that is, they can send input to Djazz (<em>control</em>) as well as show output (<em>view</em>).</p>
<p>The two <strong>device-specific</strong> dicts are imported from JSON files; thus are two <strong>device-specific</strong> files:</p>
<ul>
<li>the <strong>device</strong> file</li>
<li>the <strong>grid</strong> file</li>
</ul>
<p>These must be written in order to connect a new device with view and control capabilities, like a Launchpad, to Djazz.</p>
<p>The <strong>device</strong> file contains device-specific data:</p>
<ul>
<li>the device name (used for routing messages in Djazz)</li>
<li>any metadata about the device itself</li>
<li>the number of midi controls</li>
<li>the number of cc controls</li>
<li>the MIDI/CC codes for each color. Colors are represented by two variables, their <em>hue</em> (the name of the color itself) and their <em>value</em> (bright or dim).</li>
<li>the MIDI/CC codes for each button&rsquo;s illumination behavior. For the Launchpad Pro MK3, buttons can glow statically, they can flash, or they can pulse.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the Launchpad Pro MK3, the data file is this:</p>

<li>
<p>the device name</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the cell numbers that represent song chapters. These are listed in order of the chapters they represent. In the following code example, then, &ldquo;cc 89&rdquo; represents chapter 1, &ldquo;cc 79&rdquo; represents chapter 2, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the colors that represent the state of a chapter in the grid. A grid cell (chapter or bar)
is in one of the following states:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>playing</strong>: the cell is currently being played</li>
<li><strong>waiting</strong>: the cell has been selected to be played, and will start playing as soon as the next beat occurs</li>
<li><strong>off</strong>: neither waiting or playing</li>
<li><strong>unused</strong>: the song does not contain the chapter or bar associated with this cell</li>

<p>The <strong>color-code</strong> file is imported into the <strong>database accessor</strong> files that are common to Launchpads.</p>
<p>The <strong>database accessor</strong> files exist to translate between the formats of the various dicts.</p>
<p>The structure for each of these dicts can be done in different ways. Some criteria exist:</p>
<p>The user-created dict must be easy to create, either by editing the text or with a max object</p>
<p>The program-read dicts must be efficient, easily read by the program.</p>
<p>These two criteria are different and ask for different structures. Also, there is not a given good structure for any of these dicts, and we might want to change them later. We might even have to, as new launchpads, and new devices, use different formats.</p>
<p>So there‚Äôs not a general method for structuring these dicts. But we want something general so that we don‚Äôt have to rewrite a new patch and dict-accessors for each new launchpad.</p>
<p>To solve this, we create dict-readers and dict-writers, two types of javascript objects. Each one exports a set of methods that access data or modify data. The implementation of the methods are hidden to the user.
Each one is specific to the context it acts in. The exported methods have the same names, but the implementation is different depending on the structure of the dict it reads or writes to.
Thus, we can use a single javascript object to read the desired dictionaries and then translate them into the format the system needs.
Each reader and writer is imported into the module using a require statement.
If we change or add a new dict format, we write a new reader‚Äîwhich only involves rewriting the implementation of the exported methods‚Äîand replace it in the appropriate require field. These can also be jsarguments.
This way, we have translators: objects that take a reader and a writer.</p>

<p>Input is passed to patchers two ways: synchronously and asynchronously, depending on the type of input data.
Synchoronous data consists of the beat number, the current tempo (since this can fluctuate), and any data to be used by the analyzer.
This data is passed serially through patch cords which send data serially.</p>
<p>The generator uses the beat number when improvise mode is not on; it uses this to play the next beat or a different beat if one has been
selected by the user.
In improvise mode, the beat number is not considered. The label produced by the analyzer is used, as described above.</p>
<p>Asynchoronous data is anything changed by the user using the GUI. A lot of this data is well known to audio interface users: track volume,
MIDI and audio effects like pitch transposition, for instance. The factor oracle player has two asynchronous controls: max-continuity and
pitch-transposition.</p>

<p>The beat generator can play in two modes: score player and improviser. Each of these also contain two modes: play at the tempo given by the tap,
or play at a different speed: double speed, quadruple speed, half speed, and one and a half speed.  This speed change is controlled
by an object&ndash;the &ldquo;Speed Control&rdquo; that, when messages are passed to the generator, modifies the timing of their distribution to the generator&rsquo;s internal objects.
Even though both the score player and the improviser use the Speed Control, the result is different, because the Score Player receives
beat <em>number</em> messages and the Improviser receives beat <em>label</em> messages.</p>
<p>The Score Player contains two subpatchers, a &ldquo;Master Clock Follower&rdquo; and an &ldquo;Internal Clock Follower.&rdquo; In Score Player mode,
if the Speed Control is active, beat numbers are sent to the Internal Clock Follower, which outputs beat numbers at a different tempo than
the input tap. The musical result is an interesting version of &ldquo;playing out:&rdquo; beats are played at a different rate, meaning their
internal harmony, given by each beat&rsquo;s chord label, no longer aligns with that of the other tracks:</p>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>The Internal Clock Follower contains its own Beat Clock object. It is passed the same asynchronous messages as the Master Beat Clock,
concerning the song beat data like the end beat, the current section beats, and whether the current chapter is being looped.
If the Speed Control is inactive, the beat number messages given by the Master Beat Clock are simply passed through.</p>
<p>In the Improviser, it is the beat label messages are passed. Beat labels are passed in at the master tempo. When a label is received, it is saved in
a message object and a bang is sent to the Speed Control. If active, the speed control at its modified tempo, which trigger the saved
label to be passed to the factor oracle player. The result is that the factor oracle player outputs beats that conform to
the harmony of the given beat, even though they are at a different tempo:</p>

<h3 id="the-factor-oracle-factor_oraclemaxpat">The factor oracle (&ldquo;factor_oracle.maxpat&rdquo;)</h3>
<p>The factor oracle player creates the improvisation. As its name suggests, it contains and makes use of the &ldquo;factor_oracle&rdquo; Max abstraction.</p>
<p>The analyzer uses the same set of symbols as the factor oracle. It is used both offline, to create a file of labeled beats for a song, and online, to convert the data at the beginning of each beat into a symbol to be passed to the factor oracle player.
This symbol is then used as the query to the factor oracle to produce the next beat.</p>
<h2 id="the-analyzer">The analyzer</h2>
<p>Definition:</p>
<p>A beat is a collection of notes that occurs between two timepoints. These timepoints are considered to occur at regular intervals.
Thus a piece of music that has a pulse can be considered a sequence of beats.</p>
<p>At each new beat, calculate a new beat&rsquo;s worth of music to play. The calculation consists of finding a beat in the database that is the
‚Äúbest match‚Äù (or at least a ‚Äúgood match‚Äù) based on the data that exists at the beginning of the new beat.</p>
<p>This data can be based on any of the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The location in the song/musical piece.  For example, ‚Äúthe A minor 7 chord that occurs at the beginning
of measure 13.‚Äù  A good match is a beat from the database that occurs over the same chord. This could be
the same beat as in the original piece, or it could be a different
beat that has the same chord, which is more interesting. This creates correct adherence to musical form, if such form exists in the piece.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What we just played in the last beat. For example, an ascending scale in the previous beat could look for a melody that starts on the next
note in the scale in the next beat. This creates continuity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What other listeners have played. This creates responsiveness.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In the current usage of Djazz, this match is based only on option 1: the chord symbol that occurs on the given beat. Matching is done by
comparing labels. Each beat has a label which reflects the data described above. It is a string of symbols. The nature of this string is
determined by the user. In the current usage of Djazz, this string represents the chord symbol, which consists of the chord root and its
quality, separated by an underline. Chord roots are numbered from zero to eleven, with zero representing C; thus, C# (or Db) is 1, D is 2, etc.
For example, &ldquo;0_maj7&rdquo; represents a C major seventh chord.</p>
<p>A match can be made by exact comparison, or by ‚Äúfuzzy‚Äù methods. In the current usage of Djazz, a chord represents a match if the quality is
the same, but the root can be a small distance away from the desired one.
The melody is then transposed to match the correct root.</p>
<p>Offline analysis currently consists of adding the chord labels to each beat. The user inputs this using a graphical tool that takes chord
information and stores it in a list of beats; that is, no analysis is done save for copying the &ldquo;chord chart&rdquo; into a data file.
This data file, which also contains other data like the song tempo, time signature, section starting and ending beats, and song title, is loaded
into Djazz when a song is played.</p>
<p>Online analysis, as a result, is just a case of reading the chord label from the dictionary when a beat number is generated. This is in fact done
by the master clock: it sends out the tempo, chord label, beat number, in immediate succession each time a tap is input.</p>
<p>The methods here are general, and the current usage of Djazz can be changed to admit other types of music. This would involve
using an extant system, devising a new one, or modifying an extant one to label beats. Optionally defining the definition of a
match, if it is not defined as exact.</p>
<p>The following criteria must be met:
The online analyzer uses the same set of labels as the offline analyzer, if an offline analyzer is used.</p>
<p>Also, the architecture is modular, which means that other methods of improvisation are possible. That means that another object can replace the
factor oracle player within &ldquo;improviser&rdquo; as long as it adheres to the following criteria:</p>
<ol>
<li>It receives a label at the beginning of each beat</li>
<li>It produces a beat number, in response to the label, that represents the next beat to play.</li>
</ol>
<p>Djazz supplies a software framework for empirical inquiry into the suitability of a particular data encoding for music:
ascertaining the ‚Äúcorrectness‚Äù of an analysis via listening to the resulting synthesis.</p>

- outputs a beat number when it receives a bang
- increments its beat number with each output, but also keeps track of position in a song form and adjusts the beat in accordance if looped.
- keeps track of tempo if tempo is manually input and fluctuates. This uses antescofo.
- reads from song dict to get label
- sends tempo, beat, and chord label, immediately in succession and in that order, to midi and audio generators. This order is important,  so that the generators can calculate the correct information to play at the beginning of each beat.</p>

<p>Because Djazz is beat-based, most objects are built to receive and process information at recurring instances.</p>
<p>Djazz plays music in two ways: by selecting sections from scores, and by calculating improvisations using the factor oracle algorithm.

<h1 id="pattr-usage">Pattr usage</h1>

<p>Pattr translation in control and view control</p>
<p>Interface - not much to say. Just graphical controls.
Sends and receives pattrs to and from control. Infinite loop is avoided via pattrstorage output mode set to 5.</p>
<p>The CONTROL PATTRS and DATA PATTRS (dicts) are saved.
On loading, the data pattrs must be fully loaded first; their priorities are set to 1.
The control pattrs are independent so their priorities are all 0.</p>
<p>Every parameter is stored in a pattr object.</p>
<p>As an example, here is a midi player object, which contains, among other components, a beat clock. The beat clock itself contains several components. Here we see one of them, ¬´¬†loop_section¬†¬ª and the pattr objects it contains. [SLIDE]</p>
<p>The pattrhub object invokes them, so a message ‚Äústep 2‚Äù will set the step pattr object in beat_clock to 2.</p>
<p>Pattrs act hierarchically. The beat clock is named ‚Äúbeat_clock‚Äù [SLIDE], so the step variable can be invoked by sending the beat clock the message ‚Äúbeat_clock::step 2.‚Äù This double-colon format continues as the pattr object is nested in deeper levels of a hierarchy.</p>
<p>The control consists of bpatchers. No bpatchers are in the model. These handle all the user interface logic like buttons and file selection. To change a parameter in the model, a pattr object must exist in the view with the same name as the corresponding one in the model. These names don‚Äôt conflict because they are in different sub patchers.</p>
<p>A pattrstorage object in the control keeps track of pattern changes. When the outputmode attribute is non-zero, it will send the names and values of changed parameters out its outlet.  Hence, to communicate parameter changes to the model, the pattrstorage output is sent out the control and into a pattrthub object at the top level of the model, which then broadcasts the changes to the proper places.</p>
<p>Note: with this method, the interior pattrhub objects end up not being used at all, but it‚Äôs still good to leave them in so that these objects can be reused and are not dependent on being called this way.</p>
<p>The hierarchical nature of the model, though, means that the parameter names sent from the control must have the same hierarchical structure as those in the model. Thus to control the ‚Äúmidi_player_1::beat_clock::loop_length‚Äù parameter, there must be a control bpatcher called ‚Äúmidi_player_1‚Äù that contains a bpatcher ‚Äúbeat_clock‚Äù that contains a pattr ‚Äúloop_length.‚Äù</p>
<pre><code>For smaller systems, this could be a good method: the control and the model are parallel hierarchies.
</code></pre>
<p>There are three problems with this method, though. The separation of model and control is supposed to give you the freedom to design the control without worrying about how things are being processed inside the model.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The control architecture is completely linked to the model architecture, which becomes very constraining, especially as the control logic in a complicated system probably does not reflect the way things are processed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You don‚Äôt necessarily want to control all the pattrs in the model. Some you might find unnecessary. This is not a big problem, but there is another related one:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some pattrs in the model are not actually independent of each other at runtime.    Objects were created independently, but their functions in the system are dependent on each other or other objects</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It‚Äôs useful to design objects by thinking of their function independently of other objects, even though in the system they will not be independent.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>There is an object that outputs a given number of bangs at a given tempo: it has two pattrs, ‚Äútempo‚Äù and ‚Äúcount‚Äù: the number of bangs to output.</p>
<p>There is another object that changes the system tempo.</p>
<p>The tempo object can be used to adjust the tempo by itself. But it is also used to control a parameter called ‚Äúspeed.‚Äù
Speed makes the musical output play twice as fast (double time), or in triplets, etc. Changing the speed to two means both doubling the tempo and setting the number of bangs to two.</p>
<p>Thus the mapping from control pattrs to model pattrs is not one-to-one. We can imagine more complicated networks of dependencies among model parameters that we don‚Äôt want to reflect in the control.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs useful to design these two objects separately because they can then be tested and maybe reused later. We end up with a model that is ‚Äúfeature-rich,‚Äù and the job is now to decide which features we want to use, and how they will be reflected in the control.</p>
<p>Note: In terms of domain-driven design, it‚Äôs important not to spend too much time building objects that do lots of things that we may not ultimately care about using. We‚Äôre not building a library, we‚Äôre building an application. On the other hand, building separate small objects that handle specific independent functions is a useful way to make building blocks for our application. So there‚Äôs a trade-off: designing for the application with an eye for the kind of independent and reusable objects that will make up a library.</p>
<p>To address these three problems, Djazz uses the following method:</p>
<p>For each important object that is made up of smaller components containing pattrs, like the ‚Äúmidi player,‚Äù there is a parameter bank. [SLIDE] This bank consists only of the surface pattrs that the control will call.</p>
<p>The midi player and the parameter bank are wrapped in a larger object, and parameters from the bank are passed to the midi player through a translator object.</p>
<p>This translator handles the three problems above. It translates the surface parameters to their corresponding hierarchically named pattrs, which is very easy. In this object, too, are placed the objects that translate control variables into dependent model variables, like f(speed)‚Äî&gt;[bang_count, tempo].
Finally, unused variables simply aren‚Äôt called. But to be absolutely sure that uncalled variables don‚Äôt give us trouble, by storing state that have forgotten about, or by accidentally being called, due to sharing names accidentally with a control variable, we can turn off their visibility to the pattrstorage system, which means they can never be called. There is a javascript object I wrote which will turn off all the pattrs in an object. The first argument tells it what the visibility is, the second weather to recursively change the visibility in sub patchers. [EXAMPLE]</p>
<pre><code>Now, in the control bpatcher, there is a similar parameter bank. Now the architectures of the control and the model are separate, and we are free to design the control as we want. As long as our controls send a message to the parameter bank with the right name, it will be sent to the model. [SLIDE] Now we can set up the controls as we like, and all the control logic‚Äîbutton operation, etc.‚Äîis completely independent of anything that happens in the model, and vice versa.
</code></pre>
<p>Because the pattrstorage object is inside the view, the namespace ‚Äúview‚Äù is not included in parameter names.</p>
<p>The model outputs midi and audio, but it also outputs pattrs to any view that wants to receive them. It does this the same way as the control: a pattrstorage object is at the top level of the model patcher, and when a pattr value is updated, it outputs the pattr name and value.
There are two types of pattrs that the model outputs: those that are specifically for a view, and the parameters that were sent from the control.
[SLIDE]
Because the control is the view, this flow of pattrs becomes a loop. [SLIDE] The control/view pattrstorage sends values to the model‚Äôs pattrhub, and the model pattrstorage send values to the control/view‚Äôs pattrhub</p>
<p>To avoid an infinite loop, we make use the pattrstorage‚Äôs outputmode attribute.</p>
<p>In the model, the output mode is 2: any changed values are sent out.
But in the view, the output mode is 6: values that are changed by objects in the pattr system are not sent out. That is, only values that are changed by user interaction are sent out. Thus the values received by pattrhub are set but not passed on. The loop is broken. [SLIDE]</p>
<p>The control flow is clear
All of the state is centralised in the parameter banks
The state can be read in in real time by the client windows (easy to debug)
The state can be saved as preset files and reloaded.</p>

<li>Dynamic creation and destruction of objects: arrays and dicts
Hierarchies
Saving and reloading architecture</li>
</ol>
<p>Objects in djazz can be created and destroyed, so you can set up variable numbers of different types of players, and different midi and audio outputs.  The resulting configurations can then be saved and reloaded.</p>
<p>There are two data structures for saving objects: dictionaries and arrays, because some objects occur as ordered sets [midi tracks, effects], while others don‚Äôt (players, although they could).</p>
<p>Ordered sets are placed in arrays using javascript. This way they can be addressed using their indices in the array, and array operations can be used to keep track and change them.</p>
<p>In javascript you can make arrays of objects.
To delete them, you have to both remove them from the patcher and remove them from the array or you will get undefined stuff.</p>
<p>The midi out bank is an example of a hierarchy of objects containing arrays. The bank contains tracks, and the tracks contain (among other things) midi effects. Tracks can be created and deleted, and so can effects. [SLIDE: tree]
In addition, there are effects that apply to groups of tracks.</p>
<p>BANK
TRACK GROUP
TRACK
EFFECT_LIST
EFFECT</p>
<p>To make this structure:</p>
<p>Each object in the hierarchy contains a javascript object with the variable name ¬´¬†components,¬†¬ª which is responsible for creating, deleting, and dispatching messages to, and gathering data from the hierarchy objects it contains.</p>
<p>Each ¬´¬†component¬†¬ª object contains an array of objects. [SLIDE]</p>
<p>When objects are created, they are also placed in the array.</p>
<p>The code in each of these component objects is similar, and they could be abstracted into classes (prototypes) that components are derived from, if this method seems important enough to do that.</p>
<p>The bank can be saved as a dictionary.</p>
<p>Dictionary entries can be dictionaries and arrays, and array entries can be dictionaries and arrays.
The midi bank dictionary contains arrays which contain dictionaries which contain arrays. Arbitrary nesting of dictionaries and arrays is possible. Access and modification becomes complicated, which I‚Äôll talk about in section 4.</p>
<p>To save a midi bank layout:</p>
<p>Javascript objects can declare attributes: values that can be accessed like normal max objects.  Attributes can be dictionaries. Attribute values can also have custom getters and setters, which means that the attribute value does not have be something actually stored. A getter can dynamically construct it when it is invoked, and a setter can do something other than save the given value.</p>
<p>The midi bank thus has an attribute ¬´¬†bank_dict¬†¬ª that, when queried, builds a dictionary from its components‚Äô data. It writes an array of its tracks, calling each of its tracks to give it the required data for its given array index.  It calls each track by requesting a dict attribute from the track representing its components. The track builds a dict in the same way, calling its effect components. This process continues until a recursively-built dictionary is completed, then the midi bank passes it to the caller which writes it as a json file.</p>
<p>To reload the midi bank, the opposite occurs: the attribute value setter builds the track list by creating each track and then sending it the corresponding track dict so that it can build itself.</p>
<p>The actual dict values are at no time saved.</p>
<p>[EXAMPLE]</p>
<p>This can be applied to the entire architecture of a session, including all the players. It will be once we‚Äôve worked out what all the players will be and how they will be arranged.</p>
<p>Because of the hierarchical arrangement of dictionaries, the midi bank can have its own set of presets that can be loaded and saved inside the preset of an entire session.</p>
<p>To load an entire session including the pattr presets, the architecture dictionary has to be loaded first, and then the preset file.</p>
<p>Both the model and the view contain these component objects.
Communication between the view and model is in the rightmost wire.
Building from these dicts in the model and the view treat the dict like a model, and the model and view become its views.</p>
<p>Communication between the control and model during construction must be handled carefully and I‚Äôm interested in how to do it better. Originally I thought it would be great to include the dict attributes in the pattr system. Then they could be controlled in the same way that the rest of the parameters are controlled.
The problem is this. [SLIDE] Javascript operates on a different (low-priority) thread than Max objects. When it calls Max to creat an object (new default), it passes control to this thread and continues to the next javascript command‚Äîwe don‚Äôt know when the max command will finish in relation to the javascript.
As components in the view hierarchy are built, we can‚Äôt assume that their analogs in the model are built at the same time. Thus messages cannot be passed from one to the other.
Thus we cannot count on the pattr system working when the hierarchies are constructed. It has to use a different system.</p>
<p>Creating effects: to create a midi effect, several easy standards must be met:
MIDI notes follow a given value (list of numbers)
MIDI comes in the left inlet and out the left inlet
A control/view and a model patch
Communication btw control and model occur via pattr, so pattrs with the same name (possibly hierarchic) must exist in both patches
Control and model patchers must be put in appropriately named subfolders of a folder titled by the effect name.</p>
<p>If you do this, the effect will show up in the effect list.
This gives an easy, max-less way for developers to add their own effects.</p>

<p>Each ¬´¬†component¬†¬ª object contains an array of objects. [SLIDE]</p>
<p>When objects are created, they are also placed in the array.</p>
<p>The code in each of these component objects is similar, and they could be abstracted into classes (prototypes) that components are derived from, if this method seems important enough to do that.</p>
<p>The bank can be saved as a dictionary.</p>
<p>Dictionary entries can be dictionaries and arrays, and array entries can be dictionaries and arrays.
The midi bank dictionary contains arrays which contain dictionaries which contain arrays. Arbitrary nesting of dictionaries and arrays is possible. Access and modification becomes complicated, which I‚Äôll talk about in section 4.</p>
<p>To save a midi bank layout:</p>
<p>Javascript objects can declare attributes: values that can be accessed like normal max objects.  Attributes can be dictionaries. Attribute values can also have custom getters and setters, which means that the attribute value does not have be something actually stored. A getter can dynamically construct it when it is invoked, and a setter can do something other than save the given value.</p>
<p>The midi bank thus has an attribute ¬´¬†bank_dict¬†¬ª that, when queried, builds a dictionary from its components‚Äô data. It writes an array of its tracks, calling each of its tracks to give it the required data for its given array index.  It calls each track by requesting a dict attribute from the track representing its components. The track builds a dict in the same way, calling its effect components. This process continues until a recursively-built dictionary is completed, then the midi bank passes it to the caller which writes it as a json file.</p>
<p>To reload the midi bank, the opposite occurs: the attribute value setter builds the track list by creating each track and then sending it the corresponding track dict so that it can build itself.</p>
<p>The actual dict values are at no time saved.</p>
<p>[EXAMPLE]</p>
<p>This can be applied to the entire architecture of a session, including all the players. It will be once we‚Äôve worked out what all the players will be and how they will be arranged.</p>
<p>Because of the hierarchical arrangement of dictionaries, the midi bank can have its own set of presets that can be loaded and saved inside the preset of an entire session.</p>
<p>To load an entire session including the pattr presets, the architecture dictionary has to be loaded first, and then the preset file.</p>
<p>Both the model and the view contain these component objects.
Communication between the view and model is in the rightmost wire.
Building from these dicts in the model and the view treat the dict like a model, and the model and view become its views.</p>
<p>Communication between the control and model during construction must be handled carefully and I‚Äôm interested in how to do it better. Originally I thought it would be great to include the dict attributes in the pattr system. Then they could be controlled in the same way that the rest of the parameters are controlled.
The problem is this. [SLIDE] Javascript operates on a different (low-priority) thread than Max objects. When it calls Max to creat an object (new default), it passes control to this thread and continues to the next javascript command‚Äîwe don‚Äôt know when the max command will finish in relation to the javascript.
As components in the view hierarchy are built, we can‚Äôt assume that their analogs in the model are built at the same time. Thus messages cannot be passed from one to the other.
Thus we cannot count on the pattr system working when the hierarchies are constructed. It has to use a different system.</p>
<p>Creating effects: to create a midi effect, several easy standards must be met:
MIDI notes follow a given value (list of numbers)
MIDI comes in the left inlet and out the left inlet
A control/view and a model patch
Communication btw control and model occur via pattr, so pattrs with the same name (possibly hierarchic) must exist in both patches
Control and model patchers must be put in appropriately named subfolders of a folder titled by the effect name.</p>
<p>If you do this, the effect will show up in the effect list.
This gives an easy, max-less way for developers to add their own effects.</p>

<p>The goals in rewriting Djazz are as follows.</p>
<pre><code>‚Ä¢	prepare the software for distribution as a standalone
‚Ä¢	design an architecture that is extensible:
‚ÅÉ	Changes can be made in one area without creating bugs in other areas (dependence and modularity) 
‚ÅÉ	new functionality can be added without changing the existing code base 
‚ÅÉ	new functionality is easy to integrate. There are methods (not quite an SDK) for adding functionality. Some methods are more in-depth than others; some only require putting new max patches in properly named and organised folders.
‚Ä¢	debugging is easy</code></pre>

<p>Dicts, like colls, are persistent and global, so use them only as read-only.
Don&rsquo;t use them as variables to pass around or for keeping track of state. Pattrs basically do this anyway so just use them to keep track of state snapshots.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t put max objects in a dictionary. But you can put them in a javascript array.
Max patchers basically are dictionaries, though, for objects in them with scripting names (varnames). They must both use hash tables to access their contents.</p>
