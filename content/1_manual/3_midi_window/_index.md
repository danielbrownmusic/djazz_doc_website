When clicked and illuminated, the record button arms the buffer for recording. It does not start recording until the first beat that advances the grid.

### "Jam" Button

Turns the improviser on. When this is on, the MIDI track(s) is/are not played back straight, but beats are chosen based on the harmony and the next two controls, continuity and potch range:

### Continuity
![pic](images/track_effect_continuity.png)
This determines the length in beats that sections of the score will be played back in sequence. Once this many beats has been played in sequence, the improviser will jump to a new section of the score. <p>
The maximum coninuity is 255 beats. When the "MAX" button is on, this will be the continuity--i.e., the score will be played back without improvising, i.e. jumping around through it (given that the score is < 255 beats long. If you're using this with a score that's longer than 255 beats and you just want to play the score straight, there's no reason to be even using the improviser.)

The improviser tries to match beats that have the same harmony as the current beat. By adjusting the pitch range, it will look for beats with a similar chord type but with roots above or below the current chord root. A pitch range of <i>n</i> will look for chords between (and including) <i>n</i> semitones below and <i>n</i> semitones above the current chord root. Set to zero, it will match the chord root exactly. Beats with different roots will be transposed to the proper harmony.
